# Zero Trust

Assume compromise - don't trust that your network is secure.

Verify everything - verify things explicitly with AuthN + AuthZ, and enforce least privelege Just In Time (JIT). You only get the permissions you need, Just Enough Administration (JEA), when you need it.

Assume Breach - Segment the network, encrypt data, and detect threats using Microsoft solutions and Machine Learning.

Focus on Identity (users and devices)

- Monitor devices
- Understand applications being used
- Classification of data: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and encryption
- Infrastructure
